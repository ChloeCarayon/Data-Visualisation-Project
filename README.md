# Data visualisation project

Project at EFREI in Data Visualization lecture by Chlo√© CARAYON and Victor TAILLIEU.


## Project Objective

With this dashboard, you can visualize some insights about UFO sightings. 
Check out the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) on Kaggle.


## Project Structure

This project is divided in two parts: 
- Preprocessing 
- Dashboard 

Use ```preprocessing.py``` to preprocess the original dataset ```scrubbed.csv```.
It creates the  ```ufo.csv```, but we already computed it as it takes hours to preprocess the 80 000 rows.

Run ```python dashboard.py ``` and visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser to see the dashboard.
